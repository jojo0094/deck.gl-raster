## Publishing

Publishing happens automatically when a new tag is pushed to the `main` branch with format `v*`.

You must be part of the "release" environment in the repository settings to publish a new version.

Generally, you shouldn't have to manually publish tags — we use [release-please](./.github/workflows/release-please.yml) to create release PRs, which create Github Releases (with tags) when they're merged.
